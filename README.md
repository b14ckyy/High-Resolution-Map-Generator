## High-Resolution Map Generator

This is a web-based tool for generating and exporting 100x100 PNG map tiles from high-resolution map providers, designed for RC pilots and hobbyists using Ethos or Yaapu mapping widgets on their radios. It enables quick, straightforward operation by selection of a flying area and direct download of compatible map tiles to your radio’s SD card or as a ZIP file for later transfer.

### Key Features

- **Web-based, No Installation:** Download and open the HTML file in your browser.
- **Area Selection:** Draw a rectangle on the map to select your area of interest.
- **Editing Tools:** Edit or clear the selected area easily.
- **Measurement Tool:** Measure distances directly on the map.
- **Full Screen Mode:** Expand the map for easier area selection.
- **Mobile Device Compatibility:** Responsive design for phones and tablets. Desktop version auto-hides left-sided panel in monitors smaller than 13".
- **Settings Memory:** Option to remember your settings for future sessions.
- **Restore Defaults:** Quickly reset all settings to defaults.
- **Zoom Adjustment:** Set minimum and maximum zoom levels for tile export. Range 1-20.
- **Search Box:** Find your flying field or any location by name.
- **Geolocation:** Center the map on your current location (browser permission required, session limited to 10 seconds for security).
- **Output Targets:**
	- **[b14ckyy ETHOS Mapping Widget](https://github.com/b14ckyy/ETHOSMappingWidget-Revisited):**
	 - Output path: `/bitmaps/ethosmaps/maps/{Provider}/{MapType}/{Zoom}/{X or Y}/{Y or X}.png`
	- **[Yaapu - ETHOS](https://github.com/yaapu/EthosMappingWidget/tree/main):**
	 - Output path: `/bitmaps/yaapu/maps/{GoogleMapType}/{Zoom}/{Y}/s_{X}.png`
	- **[Yaapu - EdgeTX](https://github.com/yaapu/HorusMappingWidget):**
	 - Output path: `/IMAGES/yaapu/maps/{GoogleMapType}/{Zoom}/{Y}/s_{X}.png`
	 - **Note:** For both Yaapu sub-targets, regardless of the selected provider (including ESRI or OSM), the output folder will always use the "Google" naming convention (`GoogleMap`, `GoogleSatelliteMap`, or `GoogleHybridMap`). This is required for compatibility with the Yaapu widget. For example, if you select ESRI as the provider and Satellite as the map type, the output will still be placed in `.../GoogleSatelliteMap/...` even though the tiles are from ESRI. This applies equally to Yaapu - ETHOS (`/bitmaps/yaapu/maps/...`) and Yaapu - EdgeTX (`/IMAGES/yaapu/maps/...`).
- **Direct SD Card Sync:** If your browser supports the File System Access API (Chrome; Edge), write tiles directly to your SD card.
- **ZIP Download Fallback:** If SD card access is not available, the tool will offer a ZIP download for manual transfer.

## Notes

- **Geolocation:** The app can center the map on your current location, but for security reasons, browser geolocation permission is only requested for 10 seconds per session.
- **Yaapu Output Folders:** Even when using ESRI or OSM as the provider, the Yaapu output folders will always be named as if they are Google map types. This is required for Yaapu compatibility.
